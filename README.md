# Tweeper
### Desktop app based on Twitter API for instant tweeting!!.
The app is my first attempt at building anything with [Electron.js](https://electron.atom.io/).<br/>
Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.<br/>

### Setup

1. [Login to apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/).
2. Create new app and go to keys tabs. Save the key to your [Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) as CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET.

### Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/euler16/Tweeper
# Go into the repository
cd Tweeper
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```
